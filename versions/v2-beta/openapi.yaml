    # Introduction

    Welcome to the Stash Energy API documentation!

    If you're interested in integrating your utility management software with
    Stash Energy, please contact us!

    We currently provide our documentation in the form of an [OpenAPI 3.0.2](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.2.md)
    document.

    ## Authentication

    Tokens should be made using the OAuth Bearer Token specification,
    using the Authorization header in the request.

    Here is an example:

    ```
    GET /utilities HTTP/1.1
    Host: api.stash.energy
    Authorization: Bearer {token}
    ```

    ### Authentication flow

    1. Get an `id` and `key` from your Stash Energy representative (one time only)
    2. Send a POST command to [this URL](https://stashapi.b2clogin.com/stashapi.onmicrosoft.com/oauth2/v2.0/token?p=b2c_1_auth&grant_type=password&scope=openid%20032d91df-6ddf-43d3-bcc9-8015d1f5a539&client_id=032d91df-6ddf-43d3-bcc9-8015d1f5a539&response_type=token) with the following parameters in the `x-www-form-urlencoded` format:
        * username = `<id>`
        * password = `<key>`
    3. Retrieve the access token from the `access_token` property of the JSON response
    4. Use this token to authenticate your API requests. (Include it in the Authorization header)

    **NOTE: The access token will be valid for 4 hours**

    ## Changes from v1
    - Unit Response:
       - Rename `maxCapacity` property to `maxCharge`
       - Replace `maxChargeRate` propety with `maxDemand`
    - State Response:
       - Replace `chargeRate` property with  `demand`
       - Replace `dischargeRate` property with `consumption`
       - Add `chargeLimit` object property
    - Add `research` query param option to endpoints that return unit state

        ### When PUTing a Weekly Schedule
        A number representing how much the provided schedule is offset from UTC (in seconds).

        This is for convenience sake, so you don't have to adjust your schedule to UTC before submitting
        the schedule if you don't want to. It's a small pain to do, so if you don't do it, we will do it for you. (We store schedules in UTC.)  

        For example, Saturdays and Sundays at 00:00 UTC-4:00 (Atlantic Standard Time) is Fridays and Saturdays at 20:00 UTC. You have the option
        of sending that schedule in your preferred time zone with url

        `.../weekly-schedule?utcOffset=-14400`

        and body as

        ```json
        { 
          "schedule": [ 
            {
              "time": 0, 
              "days": [true, false, false, false, false, false, true],
              "storageMode": "charge"
            } 
          ] 
        }
        ```

        or in UTC time with url

        `.../weekly-schedule?utcOffset=0` or `.../weekly-schedule`

        and body as
